      <h3>If you order a product, I will send you an email to begin discussing the design you would like for your website. I will then make a rough draft of the site with minimal styling. After that, I'll check in with you again to make sure it's going the way you want it to.<br><br>
          After that, I will continue to develop the site, checking in with you along the way. When the website is all done, I will publish it on a custom domain.<br>
          If you would like to make any other edits to the website, you could just send me an email and I would make the update.
      </h3>
